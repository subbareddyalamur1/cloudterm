# CloudTerm

A web-based terminal application built with Flask and XtermJS that provides secure access to AWS EC2 instances through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

## Features

- Web-based terminal interface using XtermJS
- Secure connection to EC2 instances via AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
- Multiple concurrent terminal sessions
- Docker containerized deployment
- AWS credentials management
- Responsive web interface
- Support for multiple environments (dev, val, prod)
- Organized instance grouping by environment and organization

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS credentials configured with necessary profiles
- EC2 instances with AWS Systems Manager Session Manager enabled

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subbareddyalamur1/cloudterm.git
cd cloudterm
```

2. Configure your AWS credentials:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aws
# Add your AWS credentials to ~/.aws/credentials:
[dev]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

# Add AWS config to ~/.aws/config:
[profile dev]
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

3. Configure your instances:
```yaml
# Edit instances_list.yaml with your environment and instance details
org_name or account_name:
  region: eu-central-1
  aws_profile: dev
  instances:
    dev:
      - name: instance-name-1
        instance_id: i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      - name: instance-name-2
        instance_id: i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    val:
      - name: instance-name-3
        instance_id: i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

4. Build and run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

5. Access the application:
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

### AWS Credentials

The application uses AWS profiles for authentication. Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials with the appropriate profiles in `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`.

### Instance Configuration

The `instances_list.yaml` file supports a hierarchical structure for organizing instances:

```yaml
csl:  # Top-level organization name
  region: eu-central-1  # AWS region for these instances
  aws_profile: prod    # AWS credentials profile to use
  instances:
    dev:  # Environment group
      - name: instance-name     # Display name for the instance
        instance_id: i-xxxxx    # AWS EC2 instance ID
    val:  # Another environment group
      - name: instance-name
        instance_id: i-xxxxx
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
cloudterm/
├── app.py                 # Flask application
├── instances_list.yaml    # Instance configuration
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile            # Docker configuration
├── docker-compose.yml    # Docker Compose configuration
├── static/               # Static assets
└── templates/            # HTML templates
```

### Local Development

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

## Security Considerations

- The application uses AWS Session Manager, which provides secure access to EC2 instances without the need for open inbound ports
- AWS credentials are mounted from the host machine and not stored in the container
- The application runs as a non-root user in the container
- Environment-specific AWS profiles ensure proper access control
- Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are configured
